    "    \n",
    "ANS: Python supports a variety of programming paradigms, including:\n",

    "a. Imperative programming: Python supports imperative programming, which involves giving the computer a sequence of commands to perform. This includes concepts like control flow, loops, and conditional statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Object-oriented programming (OOP): Python is a multi-paradigm language, and it supports OOP, which involves creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This includes concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Functional programming: Python also supports functional programming, which involves treating computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. This includes concepts like higher-order functions, lambda functions, and closures.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Procedural programming: Python supports procedural programming, which involves breaking a program down into functions and procedures.\n",

    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS : Python code is interpreted, meaning that it is executed directly by the Python interpreter without the need for a separate compilation step.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads the code and executes it line by line, interpreting each statement and executing the corresponding operation. This is different from compiled languages like C or Java, which require a separate compilation step to translate the code into machine language before it can be executed.\n",

This compilation happens automatically when you run a Python script or import a module, and the bytecode is cached for reuse to improve performance.\n",

    "14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS : Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python interpreter through a technique called \"automatic memory management\" or \"garbage collection\". Python uses a reference counting scheme to keep track of memory usage, where each object contains a count of the number of references to it. When the reference count of an object drops to zero, the memory occupied by the object is automatically released.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to reference counting, Python also uses a cycle-detection algorithm to detect and clean up memory that is no longer being used. This algorithm identifies and removes circular references, where two or more objects reference each other and are therefore not being referenced by any other object in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's memory management system is designed to be transparent to the programmer, so you don't need to worry about allocating or deallocating memory manually. This can make programming in Python faster and more productive, as you can focus on writing your code rather than managing memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's important to be aware of some of the potential memory management issues in Python, such as memory leaks caused by circular references or inefficient memory usage. In some cases, you may need to use specialized tools or techniques to optimize memory usage in your Python programs.\n"
