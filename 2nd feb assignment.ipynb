    "# Q1.  Explain with an example each when to use a for loop and a while loop. \n",
    "ANS : A for loop is generally used when the number of iterations is known beforehand. It's commonly used to iterate through a collection of elements such as an array, a list, or a tuple.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code snippet that uses a for loop to iterate through a list of numbers and print each number:\n",
    "\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "In this case, we know that there are five elements in the list, so we can use a for loop to iterate through each element and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop, on the other hand, is used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand or when a certain condition needs to be satisfied before the loop can terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following code snippet that uses a while loop to keep asking the user to enter a number until they enter a valid integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "while True:\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        num = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    except ValueError:\n",
    "        print(\"Invalid input. Please try again.\")\n",
    "In this case, we don't know how many times the user will enter an invalid input, so we use a while loop to keep asking them to enter a number until they enter a valid integer. The loop will terminate when the user enters a valid integer, and the program will continue to execute the next line of code after the loop.\n"
